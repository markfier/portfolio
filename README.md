# Portfolio

A collection of data science and analytics projects. I have divided the projects into supervised and unsupervised learning. I will continue to update and improve some of these projects as well as add more porjects to the portfolio.

# Unsupervised Learning Projects

Unsupervised learning models are something I'm still trying to learn about since it wasn't something I focused on in school. Although they came up in certain courses, I'm still researching and taking courses to improve my knowledge in this area. I use tools like datacamp and ChatGPT to help learn about and build models.

## CNN Model

This is an image classification model fit on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Refer to cnn_model.

## RNN Model

This is a sentiment analysis model fit on the imdb movie review dataset. Refer to rnn_model.

# Supervised Learning Projects 

Supervised learning models are something I'm more familiar with. Most of these models are from school or independent work.

## Consulting

My consulting project from school was trying to predict the over/under for NFL games. I fit a couple different models and compared the performances. Refer to the consulting_paper and consulting_project to see my results and code.

## IMDB

This was an independent project focused on demonstrating basic data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook. I reviewed data from the top 1000 movies on IMDB. Refer to imdb_project to go over my code and anlysis.

## SQL

These are my SQL notes from I class I took. I did not own the data therefore the code is just to show competency in SQL. Refer to sqlscript.
