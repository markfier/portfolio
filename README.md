# Portfolio

A collection of data science and analytics projects.

My consulting project from school was trying to predict the over/under for NFL games. I fit a couple different models and compared the performances. Refer to the consulting_paper and consulting_project to see my results and code.

## IMDB

This was an independent project focused on demonstrating basic data analysis using Python and Jupyter Notebook. I reviewed data from the top 1000 movies on IMDB refer to imdb_project to go over my code and anlysis.

These are my SQL notes from I class I took. I did not own the data therefore the code is just to show competency in SQL. Refer to sqlscript.
